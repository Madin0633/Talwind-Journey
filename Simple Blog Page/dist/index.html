                cofounded Apple in his parents' garage in 1976,
                was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in
                1997, and by the time he died, in October 2011, had built it into the
                world's most valuable company.Along the way he helped to transform
                seven industries: personal computing, animated movies, music, phones,
                tablet computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. He thus
                belongs in the pantheon of America's great innovators, along with
                Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was a
                saint, but long

                One of the last times | saw him, after | had finished writing most
                of the book, | asked him again about his tendency to be rough on
                people. “Look at the results,” he replied. “These are all smart
                people | work with, and any of them could get a top job at another
                place if they were truly feeling brutalized. But they don't.” Then
                he paused for a few moments and said, almost wistfully, “And we got
                some amazing things done.” Indeed, he and Apple had had a string of
                hits over the past dozen years that was greater than that of any
                other innovative company in modern times: iMac, iPod, iPod nano,
                iTunes Store, Apple Stores, MacBook, iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X
                Lion—not to mention every Pixar film. And as he battled his final
                illness, Jobs was surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of
                colleagues who had been inspired by him for years and a very loving
                wife, sister, and four children.
